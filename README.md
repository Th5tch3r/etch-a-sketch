# etch-a-sketch
- A simple sketching pixel app

Still under progress:
- [x] need to create js function so when pad is drag, it changes color(maybe use the .addclass and addEventListener("mousedown"))
- [x] need to get class to keep being added to div when mouse is held down, (setting a condition for mousedown to be true and mouseup to be false) 
        - Used object to store state of mouse event
- [ ] create scroll bar option to set desired grid size
        - achieving this by creating an input slider, setting value to equal what chosen then make grid according to slider value
                -create size value div to change according to slider
        - need to set inner html to be according the grid size slider
