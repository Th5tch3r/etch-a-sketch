# etch-a-sketch
- A simple sketching pixel app

Still under progress:
- need to create js function so when pad is drag, it changes color(maybe use the .addclass and addEventListener("mousedown"))
- need to get class to keep being added to div when mouse is held down, (setting a condition for mousedown to be true and mouseup to be false)
